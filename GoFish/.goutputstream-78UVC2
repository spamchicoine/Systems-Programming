#include <stdio.h>

#include "gofish.h"

/*
Remember deck_istance, user, computer declared in header/other c files so they are global variables.
Should not need to adjust #includes
I do not believe we will need to make anything in gofish.h atm its just linking stuff

Remember to make, then ./gofish make will often tell you where errors are I didnt really find a need to the debugger app but you can run gdb ./gofish after make to enter it.

All functions not in TO DO should be working as intended so notify me if you think something is wrong.

Hand is the linked list each hand contains ones card called top each player has a pointer card_list to the first hand struct.

#1 ISSUE !!! keeping track of what is an address and what a value 99% of problems are because of & -> and .

&(item) - gets address of item useful when handing something to a function

uno->dos - same as (*uno).dos  so treats uno as an address gets value at that address and then a value dos within that
(dos could be address or object this affects what notation comes after, another -> or a .)

. - similar to python object.attribute but wont work if its a pointer.attribute need the object at pointer.

I removed most my code in main as it was just testing functions, main is just going to handle looping the gameplay and turns.
*/

int main(int args, char* argv[]) {
	
	//This is all just calling function to test them i had loops to print out hand card values before and after but can start main from scratch
	shuffle();
	
	deal_player_cards(&user);
	deal_player_cards(&computer);
	
	printf(computer_play(&user));
}
