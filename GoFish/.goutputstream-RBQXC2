//Remember deck_istance, user, computer declared in header/other c files so they are global variables.
//Should not need to adjust #includes
//I do not believe we will need to make anything in gofish.h atm its just linking stuff

//Remember to make, then ./gofish make will often tell you where errors are I didnt really find a need to the debugger app but you can run gdb ./gofish after make to enter it.

//All functions not in TO DO should be working as intended so notify me if you think something is wrong.

//Hand is the linked list each hand contains ones card called top each player has a pointer card_list to the first hand struct.

//#1 ISSUE !!! keeping track of what is an address and what a value 99% of problems are because of & -> and .

//&(item) - gets address of item useful when handing something to a function

//uno->dos - same as (*uno).dos  so treats uno as an address gets value at that address and then a value dos within that
//(dos could be address or object this affects what notation comes after, another -> or a .)

//. - similar to python object.attribute but wont work if its a pointer.attribute need the object at pointer.

//I removed most my code in main as it was just testing functions, main is just going to handle looping the gameplay and turns.
